# 1. Write a python program that is able to calculate the BMI of a person whose weight is 78kgs and height is 1.75 meters. BMI = (weight) / (height squared)# 1. Write a python program that is able to calculate the BMI of a person whose weight is 78kgs and height is 1.75 meters. BMI = (weight) / (height squared)
#BMI=(weight)/Heightsquared
#weight=78kgs
#height=1.75
weight=78
height=1.75
BMI=(weight)/(height**2)
print("The BMI is;",BMI)

# 2. Find the Area and perimeter of a rectangle whose length is 48cm and width is 25cm
length=48
width=25
area=length*width
print("The area of the rectangle is;",area)

#Perimeters
length=48
width=25
perimeter=(length+width)*2
print("The perimeter of the rectangle is;",perimeter)
